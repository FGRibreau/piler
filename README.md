# Piles - Awesome Asset Manager for Node.js and Express

Piles allows you to manage all JavaScript and CSS assets from on place. It gives you a concept of piles. Pile is
a big named file that contains selected pieces of concatenated and minified JavaScript or CSS. you can use special
method to render the tags on you pages. You can choose which namespaces are rendered to which pages.

Piles is written following principles in mind:

  1. Creating best possible production setup for assets should be as easy as including script/link to a page.
  1. Support any JS- or CSS-files.
  1. Preprocessor languages are first class citizens. Just change file extension to it.
  1. Use heavy caching. Browser caches are killed automatically by changing the script url with a hash of of it's pile.
  1. Awesome development mode. Never gets stuck because of unrefreshed cache.
