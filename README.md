# Piles - Awesome Asset Manager for Node.js and Express

Piles allows you to manage all JavaScript and CSS assets from on place. It gives you a concept of piles. Pile is
a big file that contains selected pieces of concatenated and minified JavaScript or CSS. Piles are named and you 
can create as many of them as you wish. Then you use special method to render the tags on you pages. You can choose 
which namespaces are rendered to which pages.

Piles is written following principles in mind:

  1. Creating best possible production setup for assets should be as easy as including script/link to a page.
  1. Support any JS- or CSS-files.
  1. Preprocessor languages are first class citizens. Just change file extension to it.
  1. Use heavy caching. Browser caches are killed by chaging script url with a hash of a pile.
  1. Awesome development mode. Never gets stuck because of unrefreshed cache.
